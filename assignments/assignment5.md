* problem proposal

    * Due to the rise in use of AI within buisneses (?) a lot of what is being seen by the general publc is their use in customer service. A chatbot is a (software? ) that is able to communicate intelligently with humans in real time based on its training. (chat bots are great bc they reduce the need for actual human resources in customer service, you dont have to pay them and the actual humans can be used for something else). However one (rising?) concern is how the comunication and interaction with the humans on the other end of the bot. (Tests) such as the turing test and (others like it) have tried to develop a way to determine if a machine passes for *human enough*.
